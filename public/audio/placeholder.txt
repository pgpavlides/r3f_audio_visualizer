This is where you should place the 'song.mp3' file. 

Since I cannot actually create an MP3 file for you, you'll need to:
1. Rename your audio file to 'song.mp3'
2. Place it in this directory (/public/audio/)
3. Or use the file upload feature in the app

The visualizer will look for this file by default.
